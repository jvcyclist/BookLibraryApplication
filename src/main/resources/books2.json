Against the background of Javanese culture and the Japanese occupation, he explores the origins of the revolutionary youth groups, the military, and the political parties to challenge conventional interpretations of revolutionary movements in Asia. The author emphasizes that the critical role in the outbreak was played not by the dissatisfied intellectuals or by an oppressed working class but by the youth of Indonesia. Perhaps most important are the insights he offers into the conflict between strategies for seeking national revolution and those for attaining social change. By giving first priority to gaining recognition of Indonesian sovereignty from the outside world, he argues, the revolutionary leadership had to adopt conservative domestic policies that greatly reduced the possibility of far-reaching social reform. This in-depth study of the independence crisis in Indonesia, brought back to life by Equinox Publishing as the first title in it's Classic Indonesia series, also illuminates the revolutionary process in other nations, where wars for independence have been fought but significant social and economic progress has not yet been achieved. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Benedict Anderson is one of the world's leading authorities on South East Asian nationalism and particularly on Indonesia. He is Professor of International Studies and Director of the Modern Indonesia Project at Cornell University, New York. His other works include Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism and The Spectre of Comparisons: Nationalism, Southeast Asia, and the World.","categories":["History"],"authors":["Benedict Anderson"],"averageRating":0.0,"isbn13":"9789793780146"},"id":"9789793780146"},{"volumeInfo":{"industryIdentifiers":[{"identifier":"0763715018","type":"ISBN_10"},{"identifier":"9780763715014","type":"ISBN_13"}],"pageCount":"315","previewLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=FqRxixxvLwIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=java&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api","language":"en","title":"A Laboratory Course in Java","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FqRxixxvLwIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FqRxixxvLwIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"subtitle":null,"publishedDate":"2001","publisher":"Jones & Bartlett Learning","description":"CS1/C101 Introduction to Programming in Java Programming in Java Object-Oriented Programming.","categories":["Computers"],"authors":["Nell B.

Part One deals with the elements in Europe's strength, technological, political and intellectual. It also uses Wallerstein's world-systems perspective to give an economic dimension to this picture of the new world of Europe, and then looks at the important question of the changing place of the Dutch in the new economic order from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century. This is followed by a brief account of the history of the Dutch East-India Company in Java, and its political effects. Part Two deals with the nature of the Javanese ancien regime, both in court and in provincial circles, with a focus on society and civilisation, rather than those staples of Javanese historiography to date, political events and economic statistics. Part Three deals with the overall pattern set by the VOC's changing economic imperatives and with the impact of the successive tides of capitalism on three regional societies of Java. Part Four deals with intellectual shifts that took place in this period, and argues that these shifts were less conservative than the socio-economic ones described in Part Three and, though more fragile and vulnerable, were crucial for the future. The conclusion attempts to show the significance of these developments for modern Indonesia and the way in which some of the dynamics begun in this period are being played out in the contemporary world.","categories":["Political Science"],"authors":["Ann Kumar"],"averageRating":0.0,"isbn13":"9780700704330"},"id":"9780700704330"},{"volumeInfo":{"industryIdentifiers":[{"identifier":"0201325772","type":"ISBN_10"},{"identifier":"9780201325775","type":"ISBN_13"}],"pageCount":"303","previewLink":"http://books.google.pl/books?id=8M3F_sSSvWkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=java&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","language":"en","title":"The Java Native Interface","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8M3F_sSSvWkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8M3F_sSSvWkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"subtitle":"Programmer's Guide and Specification","publishedDate":"1999","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","description":"The Java Native Interface (JNI) enables the integration of code written in the Java programming language with code written in other languages such as C and C++.

This new edition covers version 1.5-1.7, the most current iterations, as well as making the following improvements: The API (application programming interface) reference sections in each chapter, which describe the relevant parts of each class, have been replaced with (i) a summary section that lists the classes and methods used in the code, and (ii) a \"gotchas\" section that mentions nonobvious or poorly-documented aspects of the objects. In addition, the book covers several new classes and capabilities introduced in the last few revisions of the Java platform. New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate. Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book's focused, tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of networking concepts to allow readers to synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter 3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java 1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the program. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the material necessary to get up and running with Java sockets programming. Focused, tutorial-based instruction in key sockets programming techniques allows reader to quickly come up to speed on Java applications. Concise and up-to-date coverage of the most recent platform (1.7) for Java applications in networking technology.","categories":["Computers"],"authors":["Kenneth L. Calvert","Michael J.
